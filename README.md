# Portfolio
I'm a visual designer learning to code.

I'm rebuilding my portfolio on a seperate branch 'Rebuild', writing and learning the code myself, refining my design rules and rigger whilst understanding the GitHub processes along the way.

One objective was to produce a lean design and build using no Javascript, any tansistions are in CSS.

I'm also trying to learn Semantic HTML.
