# Portfolio
I'm a visual designer learning to code.

I'm rebuilding my portfolio on a seperate branch 'Rebuild', writing and learning the code myself, refining my design rules and rigger whilst understanding the GitHub processes along the way.

One objective was to produce a lean design and build using no Javascript, any animations are in CSS.

I'm also learning to write Semantic HTML.

The rules and rigger enforced:

1. Two font weights
2. Three font sizes
3. Three keyline weights 1,2 and 4
4. One black and two greys
5. A vertical baseline with multiples of 1, 2 and 4
6. A 12 column grid, which becomes 6 on smaller devices.
